// fake-utf-8-validate.js

// This is a mock file for utf-8-validate, used to prevent errors during Browserify bundling.
// Since utf-8-validate is typically used for validating UTF-8 data in WebSocket frames,
// we can safely mock it as an empty object or minimal implementation for browser context.

module.exports = {
    // Mock any necessary functions or properties. For utf-8-validate, these might not be necessary,
    // but if there are specific functions being used that cause errors, you can stub them here.
    // Typically, no functions need to be mocked since it's used for backend optimizations.
